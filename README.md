# Rock-Paper-Scissors
the simple game Rock Paper and scissors:
https://kochiyama.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/index.html

The CSS design used is based on Neumorphism.

# The Html has 4 main divs:

First contains the home, with 3 options to the user choose, and 2 headers.
When clicked the button send the choice as a  argument to the start() function.

The second is where the choices of computer and user will be displayed

The third it's just a message telling the user if the match was a draw

the fourth will display the winner message

# App.js
In this app I abstracted almost everything into the start function (wich is the main).
Here you can see from start to restart the flow of the game, step by step, without get confused with the implementation.

After that you can follow the function names and understand the implementation one by one.
